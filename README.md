# WWE Client

WWE Client is a Minecraft Client with a surplus of features to make it useable on practically every server in one way or another.

WWE started off as a 1.12.2 client, adding every feature found to be as useful as even the BEST paid clients.
It's now become a 1.12.2 forge mod, 1.13.2 utility mod, and 1.14.3 fabric mod.

We strive to bring you the best content we can. You can also request features and we'll do our best to bring them to you in future updates.
