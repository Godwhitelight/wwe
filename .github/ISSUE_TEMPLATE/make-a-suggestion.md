## Quick Description
<!-- A clear description of the feature you're requesting, as well as what you would like it to do. -->
<!-- Example: I would like a speed setting for Flight -->

## The Issue
<!-- Is your feature based on an issue? Tell us what the problem is, as well as why you've come up with this suggestion to fix the problem. -->
<!-- Example: I keep flying past my base! Flight is too fast for me. I would like a slider that would let me adjust the speed of flight, so that I don't constantly fly past everything. -->

## My Suggestion for Developers
<!-- Can you give us some ideas you've come up with to add the feature? Anything's appreciated, such sub-options to create, the style of sliders, everything! The more you provide, the better we can create the feature you have in your mind, just how you've thought of it. -->
<!-- Example: You should add a slider under the Flight option, that changes the speed. 0 = not moving, 1 = creative flight speed, 2 = x2 the speed, etc. Make the max speed 5, since going faster than is too much! -->

## Additional Context
<!-- Is this feature in another client? Do you have a video showcasing it? Anything leftover that you might want to add, or to let us know about? -->
<!-- Example: Almost every other client has this. It's really necessary, so you should add it! Just make sure not to let users set the speed too fast, I think it might lag servers. -->
